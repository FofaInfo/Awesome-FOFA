# The Strategic Value of Supply Chain Attacks

In the battlefield of cybersecurity, attackers are gradually shifting their tactical focus to the weak links in the ecosystem. While enterprises concentrate their defensive resources on products from leading manufacturers like Fortinet and Cisco, attackers have quietly turned their attention to the product systems of small and medium-sized service providers within the supply chain. **The essence of supply chain attacks lies in exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of the ecosystem's trust chain, achieving indirect penetration of multiple targets by controlling a single node.** This attack model not only evades detection by traditional defense systems but also leverages low costs to achieve large-scale attack benefits, making it an efficient tactic in modern cyber warfare.

# The Profit Model of Supply Chain Attacks

The value of supply chain attacks can be summarized into the following core dimensions:

1. **Data Leverage Effect** 
   By compromising a supply chain node, attackers can obtain high-value data (such as user privacy, trade secrets, and technical documents) from its clients, providing intelligence support for subsequent precision attacks.

2. **Permission Diffusion Path** 
   Leveraging the trust relationships of supply chain vendors (e.g., software updates, maintenance channels), attackers can laterally penetrate into client internal networks, even escalating privileges to gain system control. Typical cases include implanting backdoors through malicious update packages or hijacking development toolchains to poison the supply chain.

3. **Stealth and Persistence** 
   The latency period of supply chain attacks usually far exceeds that of conventional intrusion methods. For example, a vulnerability in the firmware of a food industry device remained undetected for three years, leading to the compromise of core systems in 37 hospitals worldwide.

# Target Screening Methodology: The Path to Low-Cost, High-Reward Attacks

## Attack Target Evaluation

The screening of supply chain products should be based on the **optimal cost-value ratio principle**, focusing on the following indicators (partial reference):

| **Dimension**                 | **Evaluation Criteria**                                      | **Example**                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Exposure Breadth**          | Product deployment quantity and industry coverage            | A food industry system with over 80% coverage in provincial units |
| **Vulnerability Periodicity** | Historical vulnerability outbreak patterns                   | A product with an average of 5+ high-risk vulnerabilities annually |
| **Business Relevance**        | Closeness of supply-demand relationship with high-value targets | Core supplier in the xxxx field                              |

## Technical Implementation Path

### Asset Mapping and Intelligence Gathering

Using network space mapping tools like FOFA, lock onto targets with the following strategies:

* **Feature Fingerprint Matching:** Precisely identify specific systems based on Body fields, JS file hashes, and icon hashes (e.g., icon_hash="-247388890").
* **Supply Chain Association Retrieval Clustering:** Combine tender information and client cases to construct syntax combinations (e.g., title="Power Monitoring System" && country="CN") to locate target client groups.

### Deriving Supplier List Through Asset Analysis

* Use the assets organized in the previous step to analyze products and lock onto corresponding suppliers.
* Sort out suppliers based on external public procurement information and open-source intelligence.

```plaintext
Asset Feature Tracing:
1. 63% of assets' JS files contain `/static/js/vendor.xxx科技.min.js`
2. 89% of system login pages contain `<meta name="generator" content="xxxx v2.3">`
3. Tender Platform Matching:
   - 2022-2023 "Food Information System Upgrade" winning announcements
   - xxx科技 won 27 food informatization projects in 9 provinces
```

### Value Ranking of Suppliers

* Iteratively use the first step to analyze target assets and organize supplier assets.
* Calculate the value of each dimension in the supplier product list.

## Mining More Target Supply Chain Product Information via FOFA

For example: Use FOFA's clustering function to analyze assets in the US region.

### Searching for Known Products:

Search for the quantity ranking of products titled xxxxxx in the US region (country="US", replace with your target syntax):

![4991cdbc0614b2f894254ddda6c768](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/c4991cdbc0614b2f894254ddda6c7683.png)

Search for the quantity ranking of products titled xxxxxx in the US region, searching for known products.

![image](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/1740542962652.png)

Here, although the quantity of Cisco products in the US region is large, due to the high difficulty of vulnerability acquisition, we can consider their weight to be relatively low.

### Analyzing Unknown Systems:

Use `fid` values (excluding invalid FIDs, e.g., 404, 403 status) for clustering analysis. `fid` is a unique identifier in FOFA used to distinguish systems, categorizing identical web pages to facilitate the identification of common system components within the target asset range. Through `fid`, we can discover some unknown, niche assets. These systems may have higher weight in analysis due to their uniqueness or low exposure.

# Practical Case: The Penetration Chain from Supply Chain to Core Targets

## Attack Background

Mission Objective: Penetrate the internal network of a certain organization (conditions: one week, no 0day, two-person team), specific industry organization is fictional.

## Attack Chain Breakdown

### Supply Chain Positioning

Locked onto three system development service providers via the xxxx tender platform, filtering out one vendor providing food industry systems to 75% of provincial units in the authorized region.

### Initial Breakthrough

Bulk scanning revealed a PHP-CGI service with an unpatched CVE-2019-11043 vulnerability on the target vendor's assets, uploading a WebShell to gain control. This Nday is a high-risk CVE from 2019.

Located several machines storing development system source code. By analyzing the source code, identified the corresponding systems. Then, using FOFA's special search function, employed specific syntax (e.g., based on special fields in the source code, JS files, or image hash values) to search, further identifying and locating related assets.

### Confirmation Unit Techniques

Using FOFA's search techniques, quickly confirmed the corresponding units in the supply chain. Specific methods are as follows:

**Positioning via Copyright Information or Company Attribution**

```plaintext
body="Supply Chain Company Copyright Information"
```

Many companies, especially small businesses, sign their developed systems or annotate company names in the source code. Searching for copyright information can quickly locate related assets.

**Positioning via JS File Characteristics**

```plaintext
js_md5="82ac3f14327a8b7ba49baa208d4eaa15"
```

Some supplier companies indicate their developed systems on their official websites, such as "xxxxx Power xxx System". We only need to find the supply-demand relationships of these systems or use their special JS code naming rules for positioning. By calculating the MD5 value of the JS source code, we can quickly search for systems containing these custom JS files.

**Positioning via System Name**

```plaintext
title="xxxxx Power xxx System" || body="xxxxx Power xxx System"
```

Many systems annotate the system name in the `title` or `body`, and purchasing units usually do not significantly modify the system name after using these systems. Even if there are changes, they are limited to adding the unit's name, while the system name suffix (e.g., "Power System" or "Water System") generally remains unchanged.

**Positioning via Icon Hash Value**

```plaintext
icon_hash="-247388890"
```

Alternatively, we can search via the icon hash value (icon hash). Icons are usually easily extracted from webpage source code, and due to their strong uniqueness, they can accurately match related assets. This method can quickly locate systems or pages using the same icon, efficiently identifying target assets.

**Screening via Region Information**

```plaintext
country="xxxxxxxx"
region="xxxxxx"
city="xxxxxxx"
```

Region positioning increases screening strength, directly screening local companies in a specific region.

**Positioning via Certificate Information**

```plaintext
cert="xxxxxxxxxx"
```

Certificate search is also an effective method. If lucky, and the certificate has not been modified, the IP assets using this system can be confirmed via the original certificate information.

**Positioning via System Components**

```plaintext
os="xxxxxxxxxx"
```

Many systems use the same components, such as being installed on Windows or Linux, or using the same Apache, PHP versions. This is also a good search approach. As shown:

![换](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/替换3.png)

In summary, combining syntax yields the following FOFA statement:

```plaintext
(title="xxxxx Power xxx System" || body="xxxxx Power xxx System" || cert="xxxx") && country="xx" && js_md5="82ac3f14327a8b7ba49baa208d4eaa15"
```

These syntaxes are simple and easy to implement after obtaining the source code.

![换](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/替换1.png)

As shown, successfully searched for all assets in this region, although they are all IPs.

### Supply Chain Value Mining

In a system compromised via an Nday vulnerability, the running source code of a B/S system was stored. We directly audited the source code and discovered an SQL injection vulnerability (SELECT * FROM user WHERE account='$_POST[id]') (entry-level vulnerability discovery, extremely low cost).

![换](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/替换2.png)

Then, using SQLMAP to run the injection point, discovered union, error, and stacked injections.

![image](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/1740543071245.png)

Then, probing permissions revealed sa privileges, xpcmdshell execution succeeded, and it was an internet-facing machine.

Next, writing a shell, first probing the path, flipping through the interface, found a PHP error directly exposing the absolute path.

![image](The Hidden Predator in the Supply Chain Jungle Targeted Breakthrough Strategies for Small and Medium-Sized Suppliers.assets/1740543110411.png)

```plaintext
exec+master..xp_cmdshell+echo+ webshell............. >C:\xampp\xxxxxxxx\xxxx.php
```

Directly using the echo command to write a shell, successfully obtaining system privileges.

## Key Conclusions

* **Precision Leverage Effect of Supply Chain Penetration:** By targeting a food industry system development service provider (covering hundreds of food industry organizations in the region), successfully penetrated hundreds of units it served, including multiple explicit mission targets. The attack cost was only 1/15th of directly penetrating a single target, validating the tactical value of "single-point breakthrough, multi-target coverage."
* **Vulnerability Periodicity Law:** The target supply chain vendor's products consistently exposed 4-6 high-risk vulnerabilities annually over the past three years (CVSS≥9.0). Such vendors can be marked as "periodic vulnerability sources," with attack success rates increasing by 72% during the vulnerability disclosure window (e.g., within 30 days of CVE assignment).
* **Mining Low-Profile Systems:** This food industry system received little attention, was not a well-known system, and could be breached using Nday, not requiring complex attack paths.

# Conclusion: The Essence of Security Game Reconstruction

The success of supply chain attacks does not rely on technical complexity but on the systematic exploitation of ecosystem vulnerabilities. **While defenders focus on "high walls and deep moats," attackers have already reconstructed the cost curve of offense and defense through迂回 paths.** Future security systems need to break away from single-point defense thinking and incorporate the supply chain into a global risk assessment framework—because the most dangerous threats often come from your most trusted partners.
